# stock_price_prediction
This is a small project to forecast out a stock price using the Quandl API. 
The stock price is forecasted out using a Linear Regression as well as a Support Vector Machine algorithm.

In this example I used the facebook stock. However, the underlying stock can easily be changed to another stock. For this purpose, please change "FB" in the code to "AMZ" for Amazon for example.

Please note that the fetched data from the Quandl API is not recent but historic data.
